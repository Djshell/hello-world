# hello-world

Use to (try) to code as a kid, and gave up on it for various reasons. I have been trying for a while now to get back into it but I keep giving up because I am horrible. So, what'dya say GitHub? Help me be not horrible?


Filling this with my basic and useless World of Warcraft add-ons for now.
